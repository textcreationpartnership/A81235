            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Hence you may find, that it was one of the <hi>errands</hi> upon which God ſent <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that in the <hi>brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kills</hi> there their hard hearts might

Therefore when God had turn'd their Captivity, that was one of the firſt <hi>leſſons</hi> of which he puts them in mind, <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſs a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> there's the duty; which, though <hi>negatively</hi> expreſt, yet (according to the Rule of interpreting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments) doth include all the <hi>affirmative duties</hi> of mercy and compaſſion: and the <hi>motive</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>for you know the heart of a ſtranger:</hi> How came they to know it? <hi>ſeeing ye were ſtrangers in the Land of Egypt.</hi> As if God had ſaid, I ſent you on purpoſe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that by the experience of your own ſufferings and miſeries you might learn as long as you live to lay to heart the anguiſh and agonies of ſtrangers and captives, that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſee a ſtranger in your habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, you may ſay, <q>
                  <hi>O here is a poor Sojourner, an Exile, I will ſurely have mercy upon him, and ſhew him kindneſs, for I my ſelf have been a ſtranger and a bondſlave in Egypt;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169779:12"/>I know by experience what a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, trembling, bleeding heart he carrieth in his boſom,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And upon this very account God ſtill brings variety of afflictions and ſorrows upon his own children; he ſuffereth them to be plundered, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, impriſoned, reduced to great extremities, that by their own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience they may learn <hi>to draw out their bowels</hi> towards ſuch objects of pity; that they might ſay within themſelves, <hi>I know the heart</hi> of this afflicted Soul, I know what it is to be plundered, to be rich one day, and the very next day to be ſtript naked of all ones comforts and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; I know what it is to hear poor hunger-ſtarved children cry for bread, and there is none to give them; I know what it is to be baniſht from deareſt relations, to be like arms and legs, torn out of the body, and to lie bleeding in their ſeparation: I know what it is to be caſt into priſon, to be lockt up alone in the dark, with no other company but fears and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; I know what it is to <hi>receive
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169779:12"/>the ſentence of death in our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Shall not I pity, and pray, and pour out my Soul over ſuch as are bleeding and languiſhing under the like miſeries! And this Argument yet makes deeper impreſſion, when a Chriſtian compares and meaſures his lighter burden of affliction with anothers more grievous yoke, and reaſons thus within himſelf; <q>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment was grievous to me, and yet I enjoyed many comforts and accommodations, which others have not; I had a ſweet chamber, and a ſoft bed, when ſome poor Members of Jeſus Chriſt, in the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> and the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Slavery,</hi> are <hi>caſt into the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi> and ſink, with <hi>Jeremiah, into the mire; their feet are hurt in the ſtocks, and the irons do enter into their Soul;</hi> others lie bleeding and gaſping upon the cold ground with their undreſt wounds, expoſed to all the injuries of hunger and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs in the open ayr.

               <hi>It behoved him in all things to be made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Brothren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high Prieſt in things pertaining to God.</hi> And again,
<note place="margin">Cha. 4.15.</note> 
               <hi>We have not an high Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are.</hi> And Chap. 5.2. <hi>Who can have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for that he himſelf alſo is compaſſed with infirmities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man would ſay within himſelf, Why what need had the Lord Jeſus to inveſt himſelf with a body of fleſh to know the infirmities of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſince he was God, and knew all things? Nay, but, my Brethren, it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169779:14"/>ſeems the knowledg which Chriſt had <hi>as God,</hi> was different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgwhich he had <hi>as man;</hi> that which he had as God, was <hi>intuitive;</hi> that which he had as man, was <hi>experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; experimental</hi> knowledg of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the <hi>heart-affecting</hi> knowledg; and therefore Chriſt himſelf would intender his own heart, <hi>as Mediator,</hi> by his <hi>own ſenſe</hi> and <hi>feeling:</hi> And if the Lord Jeſus, who was <hi>Mercy it ſelf,</hi> would put himſelf into a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering condition, that he might the more ſweetly and affectionately <hi>act thoſe Mercies</hi> towards his ſuffering Members; how much more do we, that by nature are <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate,</hi> need ſuch practical teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to work upon our own hearts? Certainly we cannot gain ſo much fenſe of the Saints ſufferings by the moſt artificial &amp; skilful relation that the tongue of men or Angels is able to expreſs, no nor by all our <hi>Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, though ſanctified,</hi> as we do by one days experience in the School of Affliction, when God is pleaſed to be the <hi>School-maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:169779:14"/>
            <p>This is one end why God ſends us thither, and the firſt Leſſon we learn by Affliction, <hi>ſc. Sympathy</hi> with, and <hi>compaſſion</hi> to, our ſuffering Brethren.</p>
            <p>I come to the Second Leſſon.</p>
            <p>And that is,
<note place="margin">2 Leſſon. 1. To prize earthly comforts more.</note> 
               <hi>By Chastiſements God doth teach us how to prize our outward mercies and comforts more, and yet to dote upon them leſs; to be more thankful for them, and yet leſs enſnared by them.</hi> This is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery indeed to Nature, a Paradox to the World; for naturally we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prone either to <hi>ſlight,</hi> or to <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit;</hi> and yet (it is ſad to conſider) we can make a ſhift to do both at once; we can <hi>undervalue</hi> our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies even while we <hi>glut</hi> our ſelves with them, and <hi>despiſe</hi> them even when we are <hi>ſurfeiting</hi> upon them. Witneſs that inculcated caution by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua, When thou haſt eaten and art full,
<note place="margin">Deut 8 10 11, 12. and 6 11, 12.</note> take heed thou forget not the Lord thy God.</hi> Behold, while men <hi>fill themſelves</hi> with the mercies of God, they <hi>can neglect the God</hi> of their mercies: When God is moſt liberal <hi>in remembring</hi> us, we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169779:15"/>are moſt prone <hi>to forget</hi> God. Now therefore that we may know how to put a due eſtimate upon mercies, God often <hi>outs us ſhort,</hi> that we may learn to prize that by <hi>want,</hi> which our fooliſh unthankful hearts <hi>ſlighted</hi> in the <hi>enjoyment.</hi> Thus the Prodigal, who while yet at home, could deſpiſe the rich and well-fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht table of his father; when God ſent him to School to the <hi>Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trough,</hi> could value the bread that the Hinds did eat; <hi>How many of my fathers hired ſervants have</hi> BREAD <hi>enough,
<note place="margin">Luk. 15 17</note> and to ſpare!</hi> He would have been glad of the reverſion of broken meat that was caſt into the <hi>common-basket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not believe <hi>David</hi> ever ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> yet certainly he never knew ſo well how to <hi>eſtimate</hi> them, as when he was baniſht from them;
<note place="margin">Pſalm 84.</note> then a <hi>Porters place,</hi> the <hi>Sparrows nest,</hi> and the <hi>Swallows neighborhood</hi> to the Altar of God, were matters of envy to him: The remembrance of the <hi>company of Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 42 5 &amp; 110.3</note> the <hi>beauty of the Ordinances,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:169779:15"/>and the <hi>preſence of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 63.2</note> fetcheth tears from his eyes, and groans from his heart, in his ſorrowful Exile: <hi>When I remember theſe things,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.4</note> I pour out my Soul in me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My tears are my meat day and night.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> Oh how amiable are the Aſſemblies of the Saints, and the Ordinances of the Sabbath, when we are deprived of them! <hi>In thoſe days the Word of the Lord was precious:</hi>

Oh, but let God threaten a <hi>divorce</hi> by death or baniſhment, let <hi>Task-maſters</hi> be ſet over us and our comforts, who ſhall meaſure out unto us at their own pleaſure; let us be lockt up a while under cloſe impriſonment, and

How comes it to paſs that ſo much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy falls to my ſhare? that I <hi>want
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169779:16"/>nothing,</hi> while others <hi>have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi> &amp;c.</q> Oh how rarely do we entertain ſuch diſcourſes with our own hearts, but paſs by mercies as common things, ſcarce worth the owning? whereas in the houſe of bondage, in a Land of Captivity, the <hi>lees</hi> and <hi>dregs</hi> of thoſe mercies will be precious, which while the <hi>Veſſel</hi> ran <hi>full</hi> and <hi>freſh</hi> we could hardly reliſh: In famine the very <hi>gleanings</hi> of our comforts are better then the whole <hi>Vintage</hi> in the years of plenty.
<note place="margin">2. Not to ſurfeit on them.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And then ſecondly, As God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to prize our mercies, ſo by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction alſo <hi>he doth teach us mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the uſe of them,</hi> while we <hi>value</hi> not to <hi>ſurfeit.</hi> And indeed it is the inordinate uſe of outward comforts which renders us unfit to prize them; we loſe our <hi>eſteem</hi> of mercies in <hi>exceſs:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte &amp; fit prava vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptas do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</note> Surfeits do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally render thoſe things <hi>nauſeous,</hi> which formerly have been our <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies:</hi> By our exceſſes in Creature enjoyments, <hi>Reaſon</hi> is drown'd in <hi>ſenſe, Judgment</hi> extinguiſht in <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:169779:17"/>and the affections being blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by commonneſs of exerciſe, even pleaſures themſelves become a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Surely the exceſſive letting out of our ſelves to ſenſual fruitions, is both a <hi>ſin</hi> and a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> while thereby we loſe both the <hi>creature,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>our ſelves</hi> at once.</p>
            <p>Now this diſtemper God doth many times cure by the ſharp corra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of affliction, and by <hi>hardſhip</hi> teacheth us <hi>moderation.</hi> Partly <hi>by inuring us to abatemeuts and wants,</hi> whereby that which at firſt was <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> afterwards grows to be our <hi>choyce:</hi> Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I have learned to want;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4.12</note> how? why <hi>God had taught him</hi> to live of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: By feeding of us <hi>ſparingly,</hi> God abates and ſlackens the <hi>inordinacy</hi> of the appetite. Partly and eſpecially, God takes off our hearts from inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate indulgencies in a ſuffering condition, <hi>by diſcovering richer and purer ſatisfactions in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is Gods deſign by withdrawing the Creature, to <hi>invite,</hi> and <hi>fix</hi> the Soul upon <hi>himſelf:</hi> The voyce of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169779:17"/>the Rod is, <hi>O taſte and ſee how good the Lord is;</hi> which when the Soul hath once perceived, thruſting the creature away with contempt and indignation, it opens it ſelf to God, ſaying, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?
<note place="margin">Pſa. 73.25</note> and there is none upon Earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee.</hi> Surely it was in the School of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that <hi>David</hi> learn'd that Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, even when the <hi>wicked prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and himſelf, with the reſt of the godly,

            <p>A third Leſſon, which God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by his Chaſtiſements, is, <hi>Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal</hi> and <hi>obediential ſubmiſſion to the will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our proſperity we are full of our own wills, and uſually we give God <hi>counſel</hi> when God looks for <hi>obedience,</hi> as if we could tell God how it might have been better; and ſo we <hi>diſpute</hi> our croſſe when we ſhould take it up; but now <hi>ferendo
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169779:18"/>diſcimus perferre,</hi> by bearing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle we learn to bear more;
<note place="margin">Iames 1, 3</note> 
               <hi>the tryal of our faith worketh patience: the more we ſuffer, the more God fits us to ſuffer:</hi> partly <hi>by working us off from our own wills: folly is bound up in the heart</hi> of Gods <hi>children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 22:15</note> as well as our own; <hi>but the rod of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection driveth it far from them.</hi> God fetcheth out the ſtubbornneſs and perverſneſs of our ſpirits by the <hi>Diſcipline of the Rod:</hi> So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath done with us, we have not a will to lift up againſt his will. And ſurely as we ſay to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Oh, it is a good rod, which breaks us of our ſtomacks.</hi> Partly <hi>by inuring us to the Croſs:</hi> The Bullock <hi>unaccuſtomed to the yoke,</hi> is very <hi>impatient</hi> under the hand of the husbandman; but after ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to labor, ſhe willingly puts her neck under the yoke: and ſo it is with Chriſtians, after a while the yoke of affliction begins to be well ſetled, and by much bearing we learn to bear with quietneſs: A new Cart maketh a great noiſe and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169779:18"/>ſqueaking, but when once uſed, it goeth ſilently under the greateſt load. <hi>None murmur ſo much at ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as they who have ſuffered leaſt:</hi> whereas on the contrary, we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times that they are moſt patient who have the heavieſt burden upon their backs. <hi>He ſitteth alone,
<note place="margin">Lam. 3, 28</note> and keepeth ſilence, becauſe he hath born it upon him: q. d.</hi> He is <hi>patient</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is <hi>acquainted</hi> with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows: When people cry out, Oh, <hi>never ſuch ſufferings as mine,</hi> it is an argument they are <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to afflictions. Partly alſo becauſe by chaſtiſements <hi>God works out by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the delicacy of ſpirit</hi> which we contract in our proſperity; mercy makes us tender: They who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept in the warm houſe, dare not put their head out of doors in a ſtorm: none ſo unfit for ſufferings as they that have been always dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled upon the knee of Providence: the moſt delicate conſtitutions are moſt unfit for hardſhip. But laſtly and chiefly, this comes to paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>by ſuffering we come to taſte
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169779:19"/>the fruit of ſufferings. No chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the preſent ſeems joyous,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12, 11</note> but grievous:</hi> At firſt, chaſtiſements ſeem very bitter, <hi>but afterwards it yeeldeth the peaceable fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto them which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed thereby.</hi> The fruit of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not found at the firſt brunt, but after we are well exerciſed and acquainted with a ſuffering conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: affliction is the true <hi>moly,</hi> though <hi>the root be bitter,</hi> yet <hi>the fruit is ſweet;</hi> there is <hi>meat</hi> in the <hi>eater,</hi> out of the <hi>ſtrong</hi> comes <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> and then when the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to taſte the ſweet fruit which grows upon that bitter root, it ſays with the Church in the <hi>Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<note place="margin">Lam. 3, 26 27</note> It is good that a man ſhould both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord; it is good that a man ſhould bear the yoke in his youth: i. e.</hi> I ſhall not be a loſer by my ſufferings, I ſee the <hi>fruit</hi> will abundantly compenſate the <hi>ſmart</hi> of a ſuffering condition.</p>
            <p>Thus, I ſay, one way or other, God works his children into a ſweet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169779:19"/>obediential frame by their ſufferings. Even of Chriſt himſelf, the Son of God by nature, it is ſaid,

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169779:22"/>as now I ſee it is, I could not have believed the world had had ſo much intereſt in my heart and Chriſt ſo little; I did not think my faith had been ſo weak and my fears ſo ſtrong; I finde that faith weak in danger, which I had thought had been ſtrong out of danger; little did I think the ſight of death would have been ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, parting with neareſt friends and deareſt relations ſo piercing; Oh how unskilful and unwiſe am I to manage a ſuffering conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to diſcern Gods ends, to finde out what God would have me to do; to moderate the violences of mine own paſſions, to apply the counſels and comforts of the Word for their proper ends and uſes!

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169779:31"/>the Blood of Chriſt, to recover peace and communion with God: <hi>Smaller</hi> ſins not impreſſing ſuch horror upon the Conſcience, are ſwallowed in ſilence with leſs regret, and ſo do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſenſibly alienate and eſtrange the heart from Jeſus Chriſt. The leaſt hair caſts its ſhadow; a Barly corn layd upon the ſight of the eye will keep out the light of the Sun, as well as a Mountain. The eye of the Soul muſt be kept very clear that will ſee God:

               <note place="margin">Dulcius ex ipſo fonte bibuntur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae.</note> Is it not a ſweet thing to fetch all our waters from the <hi>fountain,</hi> from the <hi>ſpring-head,</hi> before they be degenerated or mudded by the miry channel? Why <hi>all my freſh ſprings are in thee,</hi> ſaith faith to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.7.

Why this is the priviledg of <hi>him that liveth by faith: No evil tydings ſhall make him afraid,

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:169779:40"/>And again;

               <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee:</hi> Heb: <hi>Peace, peace;</hi> that is, <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi> Peace; <hi>pure, unmixt</hi> Peace, <hi>constant and everlaſting</hi> Peace is the portion of him that liveth by faith, <hi>ſo far as he liveth by faith;</hi> unleſs <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> break in to diſquiet, he liveth in a moſt ſweet and immutable ſerenity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is an eaſie life:</hi> It is an eaſie life to have all proviſions brought in to a man without any <hi>care</hi> or <hi>trouble;</hi> why ſuch is the priviledg of a Beleever; he hath a <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> that ſuperſedes all his cares. <hi>In nothing be careful,

<note place="margin">Heb. 3.18.</note> yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Faith can live upon God, when there is a famine upon the whole Creation: The Peace of God is as a <hi>Court of Guard,</hi> to fence the heart

            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, The life of faith is <hi>an honorable life.</hi> It is the honour of the <hi>Favorite</hi> that he can go <hi>immediately</hi> to his <hi>Prince</hi> when ſtrangers muſt trace the <hi>Climax</hi> of <hi>Court-acceſſes.</hi> Yea, without all peradventure, it is an honorable life <hi>to live as God himſelf liveth;</hi> and this is the glory of God, that he liveth <hi>in himſelf</hi> and <hi>of himſelf:</hi> and truly in their proportion <hi>ſuch honour have all the Saints.</hi> They live <hi>in God</hi> and <hi>upon God</hi> here by <hi>faith;</hi> and they ſhall live <hi>in God</hi> and <hi>upon God</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by <hi>ſight,</hi> in the beatificate Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>excellency</hi> of the life of Faith, and this the people of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169779:42"/>by their ſufferings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God calls them out of the world, and taking them into himſelf, he doth reveal to them by degrees the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and priviledg of living upon God, and upon God alone.</p>
            <p>In the next place,
<note place="margin">13 Leſſon, God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us off from ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> By afflictions and diſtreſſes <hi>God takes us off from ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence,</hi> and teacheth us to <hi>truſt</hi> HIM <hi>more, and our ſelves leſs.</hi> This is the ſame with the former, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we ſpeak now of truſt in God, in oppoſition to <hi>confidence in our ſelves,</hi> and not in others; a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper that prevails much in our natures: Ever ſince we rendred our ſelves able to do nothing, nothing but ſin, we think our ſelves able to do any thing: We fancy to our ſelves a kind of <hi>omnipotence,</hi> when all <hi>our ſtrength is to ſit ſtill:</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we are prone to entertain and nouriſh high preſumptions, of our own <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and of our own <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Of our own ſtrength:</hi> In our proſperity we think our ſelves able to carry any <hi>croſs;</hi> we fancy our

Uſually ſufferings before they come are like a Mountain at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which ſeems ſo ſmall, that we think we could almoſt ſtride over it; but upon nearer approaches, when we come to the foot of it, it appears inſuparable, and looks ſo huge, as if it would fall upon us, and cruſh us in pieces. <hi>Peter</hi> is ſo big with love to Chriſt, that he will <hi>dye with Him, rather then forſake</hi> Him; yea though all the reſt ſhould betake themſelves to their heels, he will ſtand by him to the laſt drop of blood: and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, when it comes to the tryal, a weak ſilly Damoſel is able with a ſingle queſtion to fright him out of his confidence, and he doth not only <hi>forſake,</hi> but <hi>forſwear</hi> his Lord. <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton,</hi> in the Book of Martyrs, will

            <p>And, 2. As we are prone to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of our own ſtrength, ſo <hi>we are very apt to idolize our own wiſdom;</hi> to lean to our own underſtanding, and think by our policy to wind our ſelves out of any labyrinth of trouble and perplexity. But we find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; when we come into the ſnare, we then are forced to cry out with the Church, <hi>He hath hedged me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that I cannot get out,
<note place="margin">Lam. 3.7.</note> he hath made my chain heavy:</hi> Like a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor that hath broke priſon; he thinks to <hi>run</hi> away, but he hath an heavy chain upon his heel, that ſpoils his haſte; and being fenced in round about, he goeth to this corner, hoping to find ſome gap, but there he finds the hedg made up with thorns; and to another corner, and there alſo the <hi>bryars</hi> ſtop him, &amp;c.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169779:84"/>O thou diſcouraged Soul, ſay not God doth not teach thee <hi>at all,</hi> if he do not teach thee <hi>all at once: The entrance of thy Word giveth light:</hi> God lets in light by <hi>degrees:</hi> Uſually God teacheth his children, as we teach ours, <hi>now a little and then a little;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 Caution, nor all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</note> When we ſay, that God teacheth whom he chaſteneth, and teacheth them thus and thus; it is not to be underſtood as if he taught <hi>All alike:</hi> God hath <hi>ſeveral Forms</hi> in the School of <hi>Affliction,</hi> as well as in the School of the <hi>Word:</hi> There be <hi>fathers</hi> for <hi>experience,

               <p>Thirdly, When we ſay,
<note place="margin">3 Caution, Divine Teaching doth put the Soul into an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eſtate.</note> that God teacheth <hi>powerfully</hi> and <hi>abidingly,</hi> it is not to be underſtood <hi>as if theſe teachings did put the Soul into an immutable evenneſs of ſpirit,</hi> or freed it from all <hi>inſurrections</hi> and <hi>diſturbances</hi> from oppoſite corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſuch a frame of Soul is onely the priviledg of the <hi>glorified eſtate,</hi> wherein we ſhall ſee God <hi>face to face,</hi> and dwell in <hi>immutability</hi> it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169779:85"/>ſelf to all eternity: Here the Church hath its <hi>fulls</hi> and its <hi>wains.

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>theſe things are unſeparable</hi> to Covenant-Teaching.
<note place="margin">What is unſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. 1. Senſe of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Rom. 7.23</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, The Soul is thereby <hi>made ſenſible of the leaſt ſtirrings and whisperings of corruption: I finde a law in my members warring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of my minde:</hi> Others <hi>have</hi> it, but they do not <hi>finde</hi> it, they are not <hi>ſenſible</hi> of the <hi>law in their members, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. They are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> 
                  <hi>They are exceedingly displeaſed with the oppoſition they finde in their natures</hi> againſt the Teachings of God; and do riſe up in indignation againſt all that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which is in the unregenerate part, in what kinde ſoever: <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? and

And ſo in other caſes doth the Soul chide down diſtempers, and uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly workings of ſpirit: the Soul is full of diſplicency againſt it ſelf; <hi>ſo fooliſh was I, and ignorant,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 73.22.</note> as a beaſt before thee:</hi> it cannot finde words bad enough to give it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And if that will not do,
<note place="margin">3. They pray down temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Pſal. 46 6</note> then <hi>they go to God in prayer,</hi> and ſpread their temptations before the Lord; <hi>O my God, my Soul is cast down within me:</hi> When they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay the ſtorm, and ſtill the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts by their own word, then (with the <hi>Diſciples</hi> in the ſhip) they go and <hi>awaken Chriſt,</hi> and deſire him by his <hi>powerful Word</hi> to rebuke them, that there may be a calm: They go and pray out their diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,

               <p>And fifthly, Not onely ſo, but by the help of Divine Teaching <hi>the ſoul
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169779:86"/>gets ground of that fleſhly oppoſition,</hi> wherewith it is moleſted by degrees. <hi>In the day when I cryed,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 138.2</note> thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweredſt me; and ſtrengthenedſt me with ſtrength in my Soul: Prayer</hi> brought in <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> brought in <hi>ſtrength,</hi> whereby he got ground of his diſtempers; and though all was not done at firſt, yet his comfort was, all ſhould be done in Gods time, Verſ. 8. <hi>The Lord will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that which concerneth me:</hi> I am not <hi>perfect,</hi> but I ſhall be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: He that hath begun a good work, will perform it till the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Though the Soul be not always the ſame for <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> yet <hi>it is always the ſame for purpoſe and deſign: Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have respect to all thy Commandments:</hi> Though he could not <hi>keep</hi> all, he could <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> all the Commandments of God: <hi>My Soul preſſeth hard after God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 63.8</note> Crouds of oppoſition intercepted and diſturbed his ſweet and conſtant communion with God: ſometimes
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169779:87"/>he brake through that croud by main ſtrength to recover Gods preſence again; <hi>My Soul preſſeth bard after thee:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil 3.12 13</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>preſſing after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> when he could not <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, The Soul hath not always (poſſibly) the ſame <hi>reliſh</hi> and taſte of divine Truths and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but it hath the ſame <hi>eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat:</hi> it keeps up high <hi>appreciating thoughts</hi> of ſpiritual things; and when it cannot <hi>reliſh</hi> them, yet even then it doth <hi>hunger</hi> after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Soul breaketh for the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it hath unto thy Judgments</hi> AT ALL TIMES.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119 20</note>
               </p>
               <p>And yet even in reference to theſe diſpoſitions, which I call inſeparable concomitants to Saving Teaching, I muſt add this one <hi>Caution</hi> in cloſe of all; namely,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That allowance be made in caſe of Deſertion:</hi> A childe of God, for cauſes which here we cannot ſtand to mention, may be caſt into ſo deep a ſtate of deſertion (for a time) that he may (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169779:87"/>that he was purged from his old ſins:
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.9 Iſa. 50.10</note> A childe of Light may walk in Darkneſs.</hi> And though there be no ſuch <hi>deliquium gratiae,</hi> no ſuch ſwoon in the new-man, wherein both habits and acts do ceaſe, yet they may be ſo ſtupified by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the preſent Temptation, as the poor Soul ſhall be ſenſible of neither, but reduc'd as it were into ſuch a ſtate, as when grace was but an <hi>embrie</hi> in the womb; that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life ſhall be <hi>tantum non extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guit; there may be life,
<note place="margin">Vivit &amp; eſt vitae, neſcius ipſe ſuae.</note> but no ſenſe of that life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More might be added, but I am ſenſible how this Diſcourſe ſwells beyond the proportion I intended, and therefore I muſt haſten. Thus much therefore for the ſecond thing propounded in the Doctrinal part; <hi>the nature and properties of Divine Teaching.</hi> I come now to</p>

<note place="margin">Ier. 43.2</note> The <hi>proud men</hi> in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> when they could <hi>clude</hi> the meſſage of God by his Prophet no longer, do at length ſtiffen into down-right Rebellion: firſt they <hi>ſhift, Thou ſpeakeſt falſly, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. It ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth the heart.</note> 
                  <hi>Affliction is Gods forge wherein he ſoftens the iron heart:</hi> There is no dealing with the Iron while it remaineth in its own native coldneſs and hardneſs; put it into the fire, make it red-hot there, and you may ſtamp upon it any figure or impreſſion you pleaſe:
<note place="margin">Iob 65.10</note> 
                  <hi>God maketh my heart ſoft,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job:</hi> melted veſſels are impreſſive to any form.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169779:90"/>unformable to the Miniſtry of the Word, while <hi>God ſends his prophets, riſing up early, and ſending them; and yet they will not encline their ear, but harder their necks</hi> againſt divine Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>earthly heart</hi> of man is ſo <hi>dryed</hi> and <hi>hardened</hi> by a long <hi>ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine</hi> of proſperity, that the <hi>plough</hi> of the ſpiritual Husbandman can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter,

               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth man attentive to God.</note> By Chaſtiſement <hi>man is made more attentive unto God:</hi> In proſperity the world makes ſuch a noiſe in a mans ears, that God cannot be heard;

When <hi>Joab</hi> would not come to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> he ſets his field on fire, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.30. And thus after neglects God brings us to treat with him by affliction: God ſaith as it were, <hi>Come, let us reaſon together;</hi> and the Soul eccho's back again, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy ſervant hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> and when the Soul is thus <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent unto God,</hi> He cometh and <hi>ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169779:91"/>Instruction</hi> by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly,
<note place="margin">4. Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an Eye-ſalve.</note> 
                  <hi>Affliction is an Eye-ſalve,</hi> whereby God open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the eye of the Soul to ſee the need of divine Teaching, by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of its own brutiſh ignorance of God, and of his ways, under all divine Adminiſtrations; as <hi>Ephraim</hi> once <hi>bemoaned himſelf</hi> to the Lord, <hi>I have been as a bullock unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to the yoke:</hi> the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> will Engliſh it, <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 73.22</note> and like a beaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee:</hi> And by means of this diſcovery God draws out the heart into humble and holy ſupplication for Divine Teaching;
<note place="margin">Iob 34.32</note> 
                  <hi>That which I ſee not, teach thou me; and if I have done iniquity, I will do no more:</hi> When or how cometh the Sinner thus to put in for Inſtruction? why, Verſ. 31. <hi>I have born chastiſement: Correction</hi> diſcovered the need of <hi>Inſtruction; That which I ſee not, teach thou me:</hi> And thus <hi>Ephraim, Thou haſt chastiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed;</hi> but blows alone will not do it: therefore it follows, <hi>Turn
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169779:92"/>thou me, and I ſhall be turned:</hi> though Chaſtiſement could not turn <hi>Ephraim,</hi> yet it made him ſee an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of divine power to his converſion; leſs then Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence would not ſerve the turn.</p>
               <p>And when God hath brought the heart once into this frame, <hi>ſc.</hi> to ſee, and be affected with the ſenſe of its own ignorance and impotency, and to lie in the duſt at Gods feet, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly importuning an effectual Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Heaven; if God ſhould withhold it, he ſhould fail not his <hi>promiſe</hi> onely, but his own <hi>counſel</hi> and <hi>project:</hi> in reference to which <hi>God cannot lye;</hi> but <hi>when he hath prepared the heart to pray,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 10 17</note> He will cauſe his ear to hear:</hi> When God hath engaged the heart in holy deſires of ſaving Inſtruction, it is not <hi>mercy</hi> onely in God, but <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> to ſatisfie the deſire of his own Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

               <p>Thus much for the third particular thing propounded for the opening

               <p>Now I ſay, what is the reaſon that God ſuffers affliction to lie ſo long upon the backs of his children?
